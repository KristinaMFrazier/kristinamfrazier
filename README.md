## Hi, I'm Kristina ðŸ‘‹

### About Me:
I currently live in Pittsburgh, PA and I work for Uber's Advanced Technology Group - I am enjoying helping make Autonomous Vehicles a reality! I started my career as an Urban Planner, but I'm following my passion for data and tech and pursuing a new career in data analytics.

I am formally trained in Geographic Information Systems at the graduate degree level, but in the past three years I've completed several online bootcamps (through Udacity and Coursera) and in-person workshops (with Metis and General Assembly) to hone my skills with Python, SQL, and practical statistics.

GitHub is where I showcase all of the coding and data projects I am most proud of and am currently working on - keep reading for a list of projects that best demonstrate my skills.

### Here's what I can do:

**SQL Querying**
  - I am highly proficient in PostgreSQL and MS Access Database querying, as well as table and schema maintenace and management. I completed the following reports by querying data in PostgreSQL in completion of Udacity's Programming for Data Science and Data Analyst Nanodegrees:
    - [Investigating the PostgreSQL Sakila DVD Rental Database.](https://github.com/KristinaMFrazier/udacitysakila) For this project, I worked with a local installation of PostgreSQL using 
pgAdmin. 
    - [Comparing global and local annual temperatures](https://github.com/KristinaMFrazier/udacityweathertrends).

**Python Data Wrangling and Visualization**
  - [Python Programming and APIs:](https://github.com/KristinaMFrazier/etsy_crepepaperflowers) Here is a series of Python code I authored to extract and clean Etsy marketplace listings.
  - [Data Wrangling with Python:](https://github.com/KristinaMFrazier/udacitydatawrangle) I wrangled tweet data from the We Rate Dogs twitter account.
  - [Data Visualization with Python:](https://github.com/KristinaMFrazier/udacitydataviz) For this project, I use Pandas, MatplotLib, and Seaborn plots to learn more about pricing trends among a subset of Etsy marketplace listings. (repo coming soon).

**Data Research and Reporting**
  - I have two years of professional experience working as a data analyst for Arlington County Government's Department of Community Planning, Housing & Development
    - [Here](https://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2019/07/Residential-and-Hotel-GFA-Assumptions-2018-Update_09122018.pdf) is a report explaining my development of residential gross floor area converstion factors that can be used by planners to forecast development.
    - And [here](https://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2019/02/Annual-Development-Highlights-2018.pdf) is an example of the type of data reporting I conducted on a quarterly and annual basis to track development activity in the county. 
 
 **Geographic Information Systems**
  - I am currently refining two GIS projects - one to build a simple web application with ArcGIS online and another open source map visualization showcasing my skills with PostGIS and map visualization in Jupyter notebooks. I will post a link to these projects when they are ready. Check back soon for updates!
