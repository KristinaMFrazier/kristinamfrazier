## Hi, I'm Kristina ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
I currently live in Pittsburgh, PA and I work for Uber's Advanced Technology Group - I am enjoying helping to make Autonomous Vehicles come to life! I started my career as an Urban Planner, but I'm following my passion for data and pursuing a new career in data analytics.

I am formally trained in Geographic Information Systems at the graduate degree level, but I've completed several online bootcamps (Udacity and Coursera) and in-person workshops (Metis) to hone my skills with Python and SQL for the past three years.

GitHub is where I showcase all of the coding and data projects I am most proud of - keep reading for a list of projects that best demonstrate my skills.

### Here's what I can do

**SQL Databases and Query Magic**
  - I am highly proficient in PostgreSQL and MS Access Database querying, as well as table and schema maintenace and management. I completed the following reports by querying data in PostgreSQL in completion of Udacity's Programming for Data Science and Data Analyst Nanodegrees:
    - Investigating the PostgreSQL Sakila DVD Rental Database (repo coming soon). For this project, I worked with a local installation of PostgreSQL using 
pgAdmin. 
    - Comparing global and local annual temperatures (repo coming soon).

**Python Data Analytics Mastery**
  - [Python Programming and APIs:](https://github.com/KristinaMFrazier/etsy_crepepaperflowers) Here is a series of Python code I authored to extract and clean Etsy marketplace listings.
  - Data Wrangling with Python: I wrangled tweet data from the We Rate Dogs twitter account. (repo coming soon)
  - Data Visualization with Python: I this project, I use Pandas, MatplotLib, and Seaborn plots to learn more about pricing trends among a subset of Etsy marketplace listings. (repo coming soon).

**Data Research and Reporting**
  - I have two years of professional experience working as a data analyst for Arlington County Government's Department of Community Planning, Housing & Development
  - [Here](https://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2019/07/Residential-and-Hotel-GFA-Assumptions-2018-Update_09122018.pdf) is a report explaining my development of residential gross floor area converstion factors that can be used by planners to forecast development.
  - And [here](https://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2019/02/Annual-Development-Highlights-2018.pdf) is an example of the type of data reporting I conducted on a quarterly and annual basis to track development activity in the county. 
 
 **Geographic Information Systems**
  - Here is a web application and excel workbook I completed on my own to compare the demographics of counties within the Greater Pittsburgh Area (repo coming soon).
