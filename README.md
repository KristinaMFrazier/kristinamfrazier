## Hi, I'm Kristina ðŸ‘‹

### About Me:
I currently live in Pittsburgh, PA and I work for Uber's Advanced Technology Group - I am enjoying helping make Autonomous Vehicles a reality! I started my career as an Urban Planner, but I'm following my passion for data and tech and pursuing a new career in data analytics.

I am formally trained in Geographic Information Systems at the graduate degree level, but in the past three years I've completed several online bootcamps (through Udacity and Coursera) and in-person workshops (with Metis and General Assembly) to hone my skills with Python, SQL, and practical statistics.

GitHub is where I showcase all of the coding and data projects I am most proud of and am currently working on - keep reading for a list of projects that best demonstrate my skills.

### Here's what I can do:

**SQL Querying**
  - I am highly proficient in PostgreSQL and MS Access Database querying, as well as table and schema maintenace and management. I completed the following reports by querying data in PostgreSQL in completion of Udacity's Programming for Data Science and Data Analyst Nanodegrees:
    - [Investigating the PostgreSQL Sakila DVD Rental Database.](https://github.com/KristinaMFrazier/udacitysakila) For this project, I worked with a local installation of PostgreSQL using 
pgAdmin. 
    - [Comparing global and local annual temperatures](https://github.com/KristinaMFrazier/udacityweathertrends).

**Python Data Wrangling and Visualization**
  - [Python Programming and APIs:](https://github.com/KristinaMFrazier/etsy_crepepaperflowers) Here is a series of Python code I authored to extract and clean Etsy marketplace listings.
  - [Data Wrangling with Python:](https://github.com/KristinaMFrazier/udacitydatawrangle) I wrangled tweet data from the We Rate Dogs twitter account.
  - [Data Visualization with Python:](https://github.com/KristinaMFrazier/udacitydataviz) For this project, I use Pandas, MatplotLib, and Seaborn plots to learn more about pricing trends among a subset of Etsy marketplace listings. (repo coming soon).

**Data Research and Reporting**
  - I have two years of professional experience working as a data analyst for Arlington County Government's Department of Community Planning, Housing & Development
    - [Here](https://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2019/07/Residential-and-Hotel-GFA-Assumptions-2018-Update_09122018.pdf) is a report explaining my development of residential gross floor area converstion factors that can be used by planners to forecast development.
    - And [here](https://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2019/02/Annual-Development-Highlights-2018.pdf) is an example of the type of data reporting I conducted on a quarterly and annual basis to track development activity in the county. 
 
 **Geographic Information Systems**
  - I am currently refining two GIS projects - one to build a simple web application with ArcGIS online and another open source map visualization showcasing my skills with PostGIS and map visualization in Jupyter notebooks. I will post a link to these projects when they are ready. Check back soon for updates!
  
### Coming soon:
I love to learn new things! I most recently completed Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree, and I am currently refining my skills with Tableau Desktop, a project to visualize spatial data with open source GIS, and building an interactive web application through ArcGIS Online to learn more about Pittsburgh's diverse neighborhoods. After this, here's what I'm planning to pursue next to create cool new projects to upload to GitHub:
  - Cloudera's [Modern Big Data Analysis with SQL Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cloudera-big-data-analysis-sql) - This course has been highly recommended by those in my network!
  - Udacity's [Data Scientist](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025?utm_source=gsem_brand&utm_medium=ads_r&utm_campaign=2045338233_c&utm_term=71049807503&utm_keyword=udacity%20data%20science_e&gclid=Cj0KCQiAhs79BRD0ARIsAC6XpaWVFotewV9_A3KcUwhwKas60lTJMmF9hHcla7UohZ4aZjXyz6KBwjoaAiEVEALw_wcB) Nanodegree
