## Hi, I'm Kristina ðŸ‘‹

### About Me:
I currently live in Pittsburgh, PA and I work for Uber's Advanced Technology Group - I am enjoying helping make Autonomous Vehicles a reality! I started my career as an Urban Planner, but I'm following my passion for data and tech and pursuing a new career in data analytics.

I am formally trained in Geographic Information Systems at the graduate degree level, but in the past three years I've completed several online bootcamps (through Udacity and Coursera) and in-person workshops (with Metis and General Assembly) to hone my skills with Python, SQL, and practical statistics.

I am currently using GitHub to showcase all of the coding and data projects I am most proud of and am currently working on.

### Repo Walthrough:

- [Etsy Crepe Paper Flowers](https://github.com/KristinaMFrazier/etsy_crepepaperflowers): I am actively working on this project to extract, clean, and analyze listing data for a specific type of product on Etsy: artificial crepe paper flowers. For this project, I use **Python*** scripts and **Jupyter notebooks** to extract listing data from the Etsy API and clean and prepare the data for analysis. This repo also stores **SQL** queries I use to establish **PostgreSQL** tables and for long-term storage of the dataset.

- [Etsy Data Visualization with Python](https://github.com/KristinaMFrazier/udacitydataviz): This is an extension of the above-described project where I produced visualizations using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to present data about the Etsy artifical crepe paper flower market. This was a student project submitted and reviewed by Udacity in completion of the [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

- [Data Wrangling Twitter Data with Python](https://github.com/KristinaMFrazier/udacitydatawrangle): A **jupyter notebook** documenting wrangling efforts of several datasets to provide insights about the We Rate Dogs twitter account. This was a student project submitted and reviewed by Udacity in completion of the [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

- [Data Analysis with SQL: Investigating the PostgreSQL Sakila DVD Rental Database](https://github.com/KristinaMFrazier/udacitysakila) For this project, I worked with a local installation of **PostgreSQL** using pgAdmin to analyze the Sakila DVD sample dataset.This was a student project submitted and reviewed by Udacity in completion of the [Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104).

- [Interactive Python: Examining NYC Bikeshare Data](https://github.com/KristinaMFrazier/pdsnd_github) For this project, I authored an interactive **python** script to extract bikeshare statistics depending on user input. This was a student project submitted and reviewed by Udacity in completion of the [Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104).


### Data Research and Reporting:
  - Some of my professional research and analysis experience is not represented by a repo here, but provides real-world examples of my data reporting and analysis work. I have two years of professional experience working as a data analyst for Arlington County Government's Department of Community Planning, Housing & Development. The following reports made use of my skills in **SQL** querying and **data visualization**.
    - [Here](https://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2019/07/Residential-and-Hotel-GFA-Assumptions-2018-Update_09122018.pdf) is a report explaining my development of residential gross floor area conversion factors that can be used by planners to forecast development.
    - And [here](https://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2019/02/Annual-Development-Highlights-2018.pdf) is an example of the type of data reporting I conducted on a quarterly and annual basis to track development activity in the county.
