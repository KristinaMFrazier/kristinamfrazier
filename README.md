### Data Research and Reporting:
  - Some of my professional research and analysis experience is not represented by a repo here, but provides real-world examples of my data reporting and analysis work. I previously worked for two years as a data analyst for Arlington County Government's Department of Community Planning, Housing & Development. The following reports made use of my skills in **SQL** querying and **data visualization**.
    - [Here](https://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2019/07/Residential-and-Hotel-GFA-Assumptions-2018-Update_09122018.pdf) is a report explaining my development of residential gross floor area conversion factors that can be used by planners to forecast development.
    - And [here](https://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2019/02/Annual-Development-Highlights-2018.pdf) is an example of the type of data reporting I conducted on a quarterly and annual basis to track development activity in the county.
